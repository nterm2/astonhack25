# Grow Sober

**Grow Sober** is a mobile app designed to support individuals on their journey to sobriety by offering structured, daily check-ins and visual progress tracking. A winner for "Best Overall Hack Runner Up" during AstonHack10, the app leverages AI and gamified visuals to help users stay mindful and motivated as they reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption. 

## Inspiration

Drinking is deeply embedded in many cultures, but it can quickly become a path toward addiction. Despite the widespread nature of this issue, one-on-one support tools remain scarce. _Grow Sober_ was built to provide a more personal, daily intervention tool to help people regain control of their habits.

## What It Does

-   Users set sobriety goals and are prompted to complete daily sobriety checks.
    
-   These checks use cognitive and facial recognition tests, based on research-backed methods to detect intoxication.
    
-   Each completed day contributes to growing a virtual tree, symbolizing the user's growth and progress.
    
-   Visual progress tracking helps build positive reinforcement and accountability.
    

## How We Built It

-   **Frontend**: Built with Flutter and Dart for cross-platform mobile deployment.
    
-   **Backend**: Developed using Python and Flask, with SQLite for lightweight data storage.
    
-   **AI Integration**: Connected to an external API capable of assessing intoxication levels using facial recognition and behavioral inputs.
